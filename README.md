# LidarNoiseFilter

# This repository contains an R script designed to preprocess and clean LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) LAS files from the year 2020. The main focus of the script is to remove outliers from the point cloud data using statistical thresholds. The process involves reading LAS files, calculating upper and lower bounds based on standard deviations, and generating a corrected dataset without outliers. This script is useful for researchers and practitioners working with LiDAR data who need to ensure the quality and reliability of their datasets.
